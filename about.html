            <h1>About Me - Kamrul Noor</h1>
            <p>
                I am Kamrul Ahsan Noor, a soon-to-be graduate from the University of Calgary, completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Spring 2024. With a strong foundation in computer science, customer service, and data analytics, I am eager to begin a full-time career where I can contribute my technical expertise and passion for problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have developed proficiency in Python, SQL, Java, and data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. I have also gained experience in data analysis, project management, and team collaboration, utilizing agile methodologies to lead projects and deliver actionable insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my studies, I am an active individual who is passionate about sports and volunteering. I also find time to help out with my family's business, demonstrating my strong work ethic and dedication. My interests extend beyond computer science, as I have a keen interest in philosophy and mathematics, which I believe will complement my technical skills and provide a well-rounded perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my previous roles at Real Canadian Superstore and Freedom Mobile, I consistently delivered exceptional service, managed customer transactions, and maintained positive customer relations. These experiences have shaped my customer-oriented mindset and strengthened my communication skills, making me well-suited for dynamic team environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently seeking a full-time position where I can apply my technical and analytical skills while continuing to grow professionally. I am confident that my strong foundation in computer science, customer service, and data analytics will enable me to contribute positively to any team and deliver meaningful results.
